Bwin : CH:OK, OpenAPI Bwin-api - Bwin Java API

apis:

Unibet, xml feed but only if you aks them and become an affiliate. 
Bet365, doesn't have any feed nor they are interested in that, if you must I recommend scraping their mobile site, 
their web site is flash application so you basically can't do it. 
Bwin, has some sort of feed but you will have to ask them I think to give you privilegies. 
or OpenAPI Bwin-api - Bwin Java API, https://code.google.com/p/bwin-api/source/checkout *http://blog.danmachine.com/p/research-roadmap.html

Public feeds have william hill, nordic bet, interwetten, titanbet as far as I know.
